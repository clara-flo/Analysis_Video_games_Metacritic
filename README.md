## 🔍 About the Project

Using a rich dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings?resource=download), this project dives deep into 40 years of video game industry data — spanning over 16,000 titles released between 1980 and 2020. The dataset includes sales by region, critic and user scores, platforms, genres, and publishers.

We combine statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning to answer key questions like:

* How have global sales evolved over time?
* What genres and platforms dominate different regions and eras?
* How strongly do review scores impact commercial success?
* Which features best predict a game’s sales potential?
