>The late 1990s and early 2000s mark a major expansion period for the industry, likely driven by new console launches and broader market adoption. After peaking around 2008, sales exhibit a gradual decline through the 2010s, dropping sharply after 2015. This decline in physical global sales from 2010 onwards reflects a broader industry transformation: a shift from physical to digital markets, the rise of mobile gaming, and evolving consumer behavior.

#### How has the number of game releases per year changed over time?

> Video game releases grew steadily from the 1980s, with a sharp rise in the mid-1990s. The peak occurred around 2008â€“2009, with over 1,400 releases annually. After 2010, the number of releases declined, falling to about 500 by 2016. This drop likely reflects market changes such as digital distribution, mobile gaming growth, and a focus on fewer, higher-quality titles.
