>The late 1990s and early 2000s mark a major expansion period for the industry, likely driven by new console launches and broader market adoption. After peaking around 2008, sales exhibit a gradual decline through the 2010s, dropping sharply after 2015. This decline in physical global sales from 2010 onwards reflects a broader industry transformation: a shift from physical to digital markets, the rise of mobile gaming, and evolving consumer behavior.

#### How has the number of game releases per year changed over time?

> Video game releases grew steadily from the 1980s, with a sharp rise in the mid-1990s. The peak occurred around 2008â€“2009, with over 1,400 releases annually. After 2010, the number of releases declined, falling to about 500 by 2016. This drop likely reflects market changes such as digital distribution, mobile gaming growth, and a focus on fewer, higher-quality titles.

#### Are there specific **eras** dominated by certain platforms or genres?

>The data shows distinct shifts in video game genre popularity over three decades:
>1980s: The market was dominated by Platform games (122 sales), followed by Puzzle (63) and Action (51). Many modern genres were just emerging, with very low sales in Simulation and Strategy.
>1990s: Thereâ€™s a notable rise in Role-Playing (185), Fighting (124), and Sports (146) genres, reflecting growing player interest in immersive and competitive games. Platform games remain strong (209), but Puzzle and Racing games hold smaller shares.
>2000s: Action games explode in popularity with 853 sales, becoming the clear dominant genre. Sports (803) and Shooter (433) genres also see massive growth, indicating a shift toward fast-paced, competitive experiences. Role-Playing and Simulation genres continue to grow steadily.
>Overall, this data illustrates evolving player preferences, from simpler platform and puzzle games in the 80s to a diverse, action and competition-focused market in the 2000s.
